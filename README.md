# Implementation of SpecGrad (Unofficial)

This repository contains an unofficial implementation of the paper [SpecGrad: Diffusion Probabilistic Model based Neural Vocoder with Adaptive Noise Spectral Shaping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16749).

## Training

To train the model, run the `__main__.py` script with various arguments to customize the training process. Each argument is briefly described within the file for your reference.

## Inference
The `inference.py` script enables you to perform inference using a trained model. To utilize this script, run the following command:<br/>

  ```
  python inference.py --model_dir ./model --spectrogram_path ./spectrograms/example_spec.npy --output result.wav
  ```
